Lock Screen Rotation Lock for Android

There is no built in option to disable rotation for lock screen alone in Android. 
This is annoying because when I pick tablet to unlock it, 
the rotation sensors kick in a little late and rotates the screen while I am trying to enter my unlock pattern.
So I have written a samll app that would detect that the screen is locked and disable the screen rotation.

Once the user unlocks the screen, the rotation is enabled again. 

There are a few bugs to be ironed out. I welcome everybody to fork the project and improve it.
